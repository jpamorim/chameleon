# Chameleon Game - Team-Based Scoring System & New Features

## Overview
The Chameleon game has been enhanced with a team-based accusation system, elimination mechanics, and simplified scoring for more strategic gameplay.

## New Features

### 1. Improved Player Name Input
- **Placeholders** show "Player 1", "Player 2", etc. for guidance
- **Empty input fields** for immediate typing without clearing text
- Players can quickly enter names with visual guidance

### 2. Private Role Checking Modal
- **Replaced expandable details** with a clean modal interface
- Players can check their roles privately by clicking "Check Role" buttons
- Modal is easy to close and prevents other participants from seeing roles
- Clean, focused interface for role revelation
- **Fixed text visibility** with proper color contrast

### 3. Team-Based Accusation System

#### Core Rules
- **+10 points** - Everyone gains points when the Chameleon is caught
- **+15 points** - Chameleon gets bonus points for successfully blending in
- **+15 points** - Chameleon gets bonus points for correctly guessing the secret word
- **0 points** - Nobody gains points if the Chameleon escapes

#### How It Works
- **Team Discussion**: Players discuss and observe behavior together
- **Single Accusation**: Team must agree on ONE person to accuse
- **Elimination**: Wrong accusations remove the accused player from the round
- **Continuing Play**: Game continues with remaining players until Chameleon is caught or too many eliminated
- **Chameleon Victory**: If too many players are eliminated, Chameleon wins the round
