# Chameleon Game - Team-Based Scoring System & New Features

## Overview
The Chameleon game has been enhanced with a team-based accusation system, elimination mechanics, and scoring for more strategic gameplay.


### 1. Team-Based Accusation System

#### Core Rules
- **+10 points** - Everyone gains points when the Chameleon is caught
- **+15 points** - Chameleon gets bonus points for successfully blending in
- **+15 points** - Chameleon gets bonus points for correctly guessing the secret word
- **0 points** - Nobody gains points if the Chameleon escapes

#### How It Works
- **Team Discussion**: Players discuss and observe behavior together
- **Single Accusation**: Team must agree on ONE person to accuse
- **Elimination**: Wrong accusations remove the accused player from the round
